# Hey! I'm Sanjitha Kurra

 Junior at San Jose State University, studying Computer Science & Linguistics  
 AI Security Researcher | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Language + Systems Explorer

I love working on real-world problems at the intersection of AI, language, and systems from exploring how chatbots break under prompt injection attacks to building machine learning pipelines that reveal insights from raw data.

Currently a Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellow @ Cornell Tech, working on applied machine learning research and responsible AI. I've also contributed to SonnyLabs.ai on AI agent testing and prompt injection.

## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: [MCP Injection Experiments](https://github.com/sanxku/mcp-injection-experiments)

**What I Did:**  
Conducted experiments on how AI chatbots and agent frameworks respond to prompt injection attacks using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Explored real-world security risks in AI tooling pipelines.

**Tools:** Python, LangChain, SonnyLabs MCP Server, LLMs  

**Result:** Built and demonstrated various injection strategies that bypass filters and hijack chatbot logicâ€”used as part of a live workshop with 70+ participants.
